# PROVA-FINALE(Traffic speed prediction using machine learning)
// In this project we are predicting the traffic speed data by using machine learning models//
Traffic data which is FCD_aggregated_10k csv file//
BAy pred file # kindly use R studio to execute it//
ARIMA file # use google colab IDE//
RNN pred file #use google colab IDE (it is a rar file extract 4 files from it and each file signifies different LSTM method)//
ARIMA for different time intervals # use notebook(it is a rar file extract files, each signifies different time interval)//
